# HTML and CSS course

Material created and used for a HTML and CSS course. 

It has been used to illustrate the concepts of each section by inspecting its code to how HTML and CSS work together.

## Notes
To edit the `.scss` files, install [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and process them to generte the corresponding `.css` files.

Example command line that will also keep watching for changes on the SCSS files and generating the updated CSS:
```sh
sass -w ./styles/:./styles/
```

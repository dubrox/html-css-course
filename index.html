            <p>
                Writing "vanilla" CSS can be verbose and hard to maintain, 
                so there are some tools to express style definitions in more coincise ways and 
                then generate the corresponding CSS files.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page uses <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, with SCSS files. 
            </p>
            <p>
                More options exist, look for your favourite by searching for "CSS preprocessor" on the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Introducing preprocessors to a project requires some extra set-up steps and 
                adds processing time on the development device.<br>
                On the other hand, reduces the amount of code to write manually and also automates some tasks, 
                like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)" target="_blank">minification</a> and

            <h1>Selectors</h1>

            <p>CSS selectors are patterns used to define what part of the web page to apply the styling.</p>
            <p>
                The "cascading" caracteristic of CSS defines also a priority system to determine what styling to apply 
                in case of conflicting definitions. These are based on the code position of the declaration and its specificity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most specific definition takes priority. In case of equal specificity, definitions that appear later in the code take priority.
            </p>
            <p>
                An exeption to the specificity rule applies when 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer" target="_blank">CSS layers</a> are used.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mastering the selectors and their priorities is specially important when using or developing CSS frameworks,
                to understand how to override the default styles imposed by those CSS rules.

            <h1>Positioning: flexbox</h1>

            <p>
                Flex positioning organises children elements flowing on one direction (main axis).
                The main axis may be horizontal (<code>flex-flow: row</code>, by default) or vertical (<code>flex-flow: column</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Flex positioning can be applied in nested containers, allowing to create complex layouts.

            <h1>Positioning: grid</h1>

            <p>
                Grid positioning organises children elements in two dimensions, by defining a grid of rows and columns, 
                where children elements can occupy one or more positions covering rectangular areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Positioning of children elements in a grid can be defined either by directly specifying children spanning or 
                by defining template areas and assigning children to them.

                <img src="./img/flower-power.svg" alt="Second colored flower to illustrate the float positioning method." />
                Floating elements can get text flowing around them, useful for images or other figures. 
                The way the text flows around the floating elements is considering the element as a rectangular shape.
                This shape can be changed through the <code>shape-outside</code> property.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="./img/flower-power.svg" alt="Third colored flower to illustrate the float positioning method." />
                Negative margins are sometimes used to change the position of an element relative to its initial position,
                moving also its occupied shape. Note that using a <code>position: relative</code> would lead to a different outcome,
                in which the initial occupied shape is unaffected.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past, before flexbox and grid layouts were available in CSS, float positioning was heavily used to define web pages layouts.
                <br>
                As an example, you can inspect the code in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018121102/http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com back in 2011</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before float positioning was available, web layouts were built using HTML tables
                (again, you can inspect this snapshot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060522143937/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/002-9382263-3415808" target="_blank">

                For simple animations from an initial state to an altered one, the <code>transition</code> property can be used.

            <h1>Responsive design</h1>

            <p>
                Device's screen sizes vary broadly and there is no standard set of aspect ratios, 
                which makes it impossible to use that same layout for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Responsive design is a strategy to ensure that most users will have a good experience browsing a web page,
                by defining flexible layouts that can adapt to minor differences in screen sizes (i.e. 16:9 vs 4:3),
                and conditional layouts definitions for mayor differences (i.e. portrait vs landscape viewport).
            </p>
            <p>
                The conditional definition of CSS rules based on device screen features is obtained through
                the use of media queries, either in HTML <code>&lt;link media="[query]"</code> or
                in the CSS code itself, through <code>@media [query] { ... }</code>.

            <h1>Performance optimization</h1>

            <p>
                Page loading time and navigation smoothness are important for an enjoyable user experience,
                and can cause loss of user base if neglected.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="./img/dublin-tree.jpg" alt="A beautiful natural landscape to illustrate the load time of a huge file." />
                The optimization of loading times at the HTML and CSS level is mainly dealth by reducing the amount
                of data required to render the page and by splitting the resources inbetween files to allow concurrent downloads. 
                <br>
                The Critical Rendering Path (CRP) refers to the minimal resources required
                to properly render the web page, with special attention to the part of the page initially visible
                to the user (above the fold).
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example of missed optimization is the photo to the right: even if it uses the lazy loading technique,
                it is high resolution image displayed at a fraction of its original size.
                <br>
                This means that even if the user gets to see a low-res version of it, the browser had to load a file way bigger than needed, 
                slowing down the overall experience.
